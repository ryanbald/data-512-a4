    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2010, restaurants in New York City (NYC) have been required by the city's Health Department (HD) to physically post inspection grade signs outside of their front entrances. The inspection grade signs contain the most recent letter grade the restaurant received from a food inspection and look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![NYC Inspection Grade Sign](images/nyc-inspection-sign.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "This requirement to post letter grades was enacted in an effort to improve food safety city-wide and to increase transparency of inspection information between the HD and the public. One of the goals of [a 2015 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330857/) into the impact of the posted letter grades in NYC was to determine whether they had an impact on diner behavior. A survey of New Yorkers was performed as part of that study and the results of the survey suggested that New Yorkers do factor in the posted letter grades when making dining decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since poor performance on food inspections can harm NYC restaurants financially, it's paramount that the inspection process contains no biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question/Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be performing an analysis on food establishments in New York City and their food inspection results. The main research question I will be attempting to answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Is New York City's criteria for judging an establishment's food safety practices biased against food establishments that serve certain non-American cuisines?\n",
    "\n",
    "With my hypothesis being:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Food establishments that serve certain non-American cuisines typically receive worse inspection scores than their counterparts who serve American cuisine because there are specific violations that occur much more frequently while inspecting food establishments that serve certain non-American cuisines.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the reason behind my hypothesis being that these specific violations occur much more frequently because of the methods necessary to prepare foods from certain non-American cuisines and not because of actual differences in food safety considerations. I believe I won't be able to support the reasoning behind my hypothesis or answer much of the research question I'm asking using the food inspection data alone. Further work would involve reaching out to experts in food safety, ethnic food preparation, or the [NYC Health Code](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rii/article81-book.pdf) and linking more datasets to the one I'm using."

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Through New York City's open data portal, [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), they provide a [publically available, downloadable, frequently updated dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j) consisting of the past three years of inspection results for each active restaurant, with the three years being from the most recent inspection for each restaurant. I wasn't able to find data licensing information in either NYC Open Data's [terms of use](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/overview/#termsofuse) or within NYC's [Open Data Law](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/open-data-law/). But, in the [FAQ section](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/faq/) of NYC Open Data's website, I found this question/answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Q:** Are there restrictions on how I can use Open Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A:** Open Data belongs to all New Yorkers. There are no restrictions on the use of Open Data. Refer to Terms of Use for more information.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since restaurant information, inspection information, and violation information are all contained in the same dataset, it looks a bit messy. Restaurants that have applied for a permit but have not yet been inspected are represented by a single row in the dataset. Inspections of restaurants that resulted in no violations are also represented by a single row in the dataset. All other rows in the dataset contain information about a single violation from a single inspection of a restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema for the food inspection dataset consists of 18 columns; here are the columns I utilized most with the descriptions/notes being summarized from the data dictionary that is listed as one of the attachments to the dataset through NYC's Open Data portal:\n",

    "As you can see, the NYC food inspection dataset provides 33 different inspection types.

There is an \"about\" document that is linked as an attachment to the NYC food inspection dataset that provides this information. The document identifies the following inspection types as gradable inspection types (with my understanding of what each inspection type means):\n",

The immediate hypothesis I have is re-inspections will have lower (better) inspection scores on average than initial inspections since they are initiated such a short time after the initial inspection and restaurant owners/managers know exactly where they need to improve because they are aware of where they were marked down during the initial inspection."

With a hypothesis that poorer boroughs are negatively affected by the inspection process in NYC, I'd expect the Bronx and Brooklyn to have higher initial inspection scores on average and Staten Island to have lower initial inspection scores on average."

Going a level of granularity smaller and looking at the effects of zip code location of restaurant on initial inspection scores could reveal patterns not seen when looking at the borough-level."

    "As part of my research question's hypothesis, I suggested that restaurants that serve ethnic cuisines would perform worse on inspections because there are certain violations in the health code they are being judged against that are hard for them to avoid due to the nature of the ethnic cuisine being served. The example above shows the top three violations that occur in restaurants that serve Chinese cuisine based on how much more frequently they appear in Chinese restaurants than American restaurants. Violation 02B, \"hot food item not held at or above 140F\" occurs more than twice as often in Chinese restaurants than American restaurants. Why is this the case? Is there something specific to Chinese dishes that makes it hard for Chinese restaurants to avoid this violation? Did the NYC health code for food establishments consider all cuisines when defining that violation and its critical severity? All questions that could be asked about that violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the same questions probably can't be asked about the second violation on this list, violation 04L, \"evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas\". The argument can't be made that live mice is something that's specifically needed for Chinese dishes. Interesting enough, restaurants that serve the ethnic cuisines I;ve included in my analysis receive this violation more frequently than restaurants that serve American cuisine."
